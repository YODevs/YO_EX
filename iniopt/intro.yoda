Usage : yoca build <options>
*** Options ***
--compile_time
Display project compilation time.
--debug
Disable JIT optimization, create PDB file, use sequence points from PDB.
--debug_impl
Disable JIT optimization, create PDB file, use implicit sequence points.
--debug_opt
Enable JIT optimization, create PDB file, use implicit sequence points.
--dev
Enable compiler development mode, which disables the cache unit and generates IL codes and more.

Copy dependencies and assets from the assets folder to the output.
--display_token
Display and print tokens while analyzing source code (lexical analysis).
--no_cache
Disable the use of project caches in the compiler(YOCA).

View and track details of compiler problems at runtime.
--mute_process
Hide all logs and do not show the process when compiling.
--disable_warnings
Hide all compiler warnings and notifications.
--disable_assertion
Disabling all assertions during compilation
*** Hints ***
The Build command must be called next to labra.yoda file by the Command Prompt."
